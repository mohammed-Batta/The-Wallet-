# The-Wallet-
Android application called The Wallet , I made it 1.5 years ago and it's my biggest project ever cuz it was my Graduation project from Secondary school 

Tha Application preview on youtube (https://youtu.be/Cm2miSCzZ0I) , u can't find the app on Google Play cuz I didn't publish it

It's an Application to manage user expenses, with many features such as 2 Themes, a Splash Screen, a login Screen using password and Fingerprint, a Local Database (SQLite) , 2 languages for the app (Arabic and English) , and so on ....
