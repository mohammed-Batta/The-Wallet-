# The-Wallet-
Android application called The Wallet , I made it 1.5 years ago and it's my biggest project ever cuz it was my Graduation project from Secondary school 

It's an Application to manage user expenses, with many features such as 2 Themes, a Splash Screen, a login Screen using password and Fingerprint, a Local Database (SQLite) , 2 languages for the app (Arabic and English) , and so on ....
